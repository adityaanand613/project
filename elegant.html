                                <h4>Elegant Themes is the BEST!!</h4>
                                <p class="texts">I started as an occasional entry-level user of Elegant Themes' collection in 2013. When their Divi theme came out, I fell in love with its flexibility and little by little found myself using it for nearly all the work I do for my clients. I upgraded to a professional membership and then a lifetime membership, and now my web design business is largely built on the backbone of Elegant Themes' Divi theme. I truly appreciate the ongoing effort that Nick Roach, the founder of the company, puts into improving Divi and the company overall. He deserves an award! It can't be easy, but he's steadfast and effective as far as I can see.</p>
                                <p class="texts">I've needed help with a wide range of issues over the years, and have always found that the Elegant Themes support team, no matter who I'm dealing with, is professional, knowledgeable, and pleasant to work with. I always try to be the same way with whomever I'm working with but it can be a challenge when things are going wrong and the solution isn't easy to find. They make it easy not to get too cranky and they've always gotten me over the finish line.</p>

Their themes and plugins work well and are incredibly configurable to an extent I've not previously encountered. They continually evolve and improve their products. Their tech support is fast and helpful.</p>

                                <h4>I'm THRILLED with Elegant Themes and Divi!</h4>
                                <p class="texts">I'm THRILLED with Elegant Themes and Divi! As a small business owner for about 15 years, I've gone through many iterations of websites - all of which were some form of template with Wordpress. And HANDS DOWN this has been the best experience I've ever had by a longshot! Divi is gorgeous and insanely customizable. The price is amazing. But what really sets Elegant Themes apart from the competition is their live chat! I've NEVER worked with a template company before that will live chat and talk you through making custom changes and fixes. And they're friendly and super quick to respond! Thank you guys! SO glad I found you!</p>

                                <p class="texts">First of all, the Divi Builder is in my opinion hands down the best and fastest way to build professional, attractive, and responsive websites. Couple that with the fact that the team at Elegant Themes never stops improving their product and you have a certified winner. I recommend Divi to every web designer/developer I meet. Secondly, their support is second to none. They respond promptly and do not rest until your issue is solved. My issues are never with the builder but are usually something that I have done wrong. This doesn't matter to them, however, they go above and beyond to solve the problem every time.</p>

                                <h4>By far the best.</h4>
                                <p class="texts">ELEGANT THEMES are by far the best themes I have ever worked with. In fact, I only use these for clients now. If a client needs a new website or web redesign and uses a different theme, I only do it if they are willing to completely update their site and work with Divi. It is a superior, multi-purpose theme that has so many built-in options, why go anywhere else? You don't need dozens of additional plugins to get it to do what you need for your business, not to mention the theme templates are varied which works with so many different industries. I have been a long-time customer and each and every time I have a question or an issue (which is few and far between) the customer service is superior. They answer my questions and often go a step further giving me suggestions to improve what I am already doing. Thank you Elegant Themes. You are definitely 5 stars in my book!</p>

Their customer service seems to be at my beck and call. As a freelancer, this is invaluable.</p>

                                <p class="texts">I have used many a theme builder for WordPress over the years, and while each has it’s strengths, Divi’s overall feature set is impressive (and growing!). It’s ease of use and development speed is great, I often “sketch” my concepts in Divi. Signing up for the Lifetime License was the best thing I ever did for my business. With each added release, I gain more features and improvements, and I don’t pay a penny more! The support lately has been spot-on and responsive. Every company’s product and support is not perfect, Elegant Themes being no exception, but I really think they are striving to deliver the best for both. I’ll probably be using Divi until I or WordPress retires, whichever comes first.</p>
